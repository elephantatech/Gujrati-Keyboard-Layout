Gujrati-Keyboard-Phonetic-Layout
================================

Gujrati Keyboard Layout for Compatible with Windows 8 with US English Keyboard works with the Gujarati India Language that comes with windows.

Original issue was that the standard keyboard layout for Gujarati Language does not work in Window 8 with a US Keyboard

After finding this webpage http://gujarati.anirdesh.com/Gujarati-Layout.php, I found the the layout that works for windows 7 so I decided to try that but the installation fails on windows 8.

Since it works with windows 7 fine I extracted the layout and have created this repository to store the layout source file.

To use change the layout in windows you require Microsft Keyboard layout creator which can be found as a freeware download at http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/goglobal/bb964665.aspx
