Gujrati-Keyboard-Layout
=======================

Gujrati Keyboard Layout for Compatible with Windows 8 with US English Keyboard.

Original issue was that the standard keyboard layout for Gujarati Language does not work in Window 8 with a US Keyboard

after finding this webpage http://gujarati.anirdesh.com/Gujarati-Layout.php, I found the the layout that works for windows 7 so I decided to try that but the installation fails on windows 8.
So I created it again and now will keep this repository public for all to download the source file to convert the layout to future versions of windows.

To use this layout you require Microsft Keyboard layout creator which can be found here for a freeware http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/goglobal/bb964665.aspx

I have also attached compiled version so you don't need to create your own.
